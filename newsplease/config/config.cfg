# IMPORTANT
# All variables get parsed to the correct python-types (if not other declared)!
# So bools have to be True or False (uppercase-first),
# Floats need dots . (not comma)
# Ints are just normal ints
# dicts need to be like this { key: value }
# arrays need to be like this [ value1, value2, value3 ]
# All values in dicts and arrays will also be parsed.
# Everything that does not match any of the above criteria will be parsed as string.



[Crawler]

# Possibilities: RecursiveCrawler, RecursiveSitemapCrawler, RssCrawler, SitemapCrawler, Download (./newsplease/crawler/spiders/-dir)
# default: SitemapCrawler

# Default: True
check_certificate = True

# Determines how many hours need to pass since the last download of a webpage
# to be downloaded again by the RssCrawler
# default: 6

# PROCESSES
# ---------

# Number of crawlers, that should crawl parallel
# not counting in daemonized crawlers
# default: 5

# Number of daemons, will be added to daemons.
# default: 10
number_of_parallel_daemons = 10



# SPECIAL CASES
# -------------

# urls which end on any of the following file extensions are ignored for recursive crawling
# default: "(pdf)|(docx?)|(xlsx?)|(pptx?)|(epub)|(jpe?g)|(png)|(bmp)|(gif)|(tiff)|(webp)|(avi)|(mpe?g)|(mov)|(qt)|(webm)|(ogg)|(midi)|(mid)|(mp3)|(wav)|(zip)|(rar)|(exe)|(apk)|(css)"

# default: "(mail[tT]o)|([jJ]avascript)|(tel)|(fax)"
ignore_regex = "(mail[tT]o)|([jJ]avascript)|(tel)|(fax)"

# Crawl the sitemaps of subdomains (if sitemap is enabled)
# If True, any SitemapCrawler will try to crawl on the sitemap of the given domain including subdomains instead of a domain's main sitemap.
# e.g. if True, a SitemapCrawler to be started on https://blog.zeit.de will try to crawl on the sitemap listed in http://blog.zeit.de/robots.txt. If not found, it will fall back to the False setting.
#      if False, a SitemapCrawler to be started on https://blog.zeit.de will try to crawl on the sitemap listed in http://zeit.de/robots.txt
# default: True
sitemap_allow_subdomains = True

# Set of sitemap patterns
# Allow to force the check of specific sitemaps if it's absent from robots.txt. 
# Here is an example of definition:
# sitemap_patterns = [
#   "sitemap.xml",
#   "post-sitemap.xml",
#   "blog-posts-sitemap.xml",
#   "sitemaps/post-sitemap.xml",
#   "sitemap_index.xml",
#   "sitemaps/sitemap_index.xml",
#   "sitemaps/sitemap.xml",
#   "sitemaps/sitemap-articles.xml"
#   ]
# default: [] which means there will be no sitemap check
sitemap_patterns = []

# Set of Rss parent pages
# Allow to force the check of specific pages for an existing rss feed if it cannot be found from the homepage
# Here is an example of definition:
# rss_parent_pages = [
#   "",
#   "blog",
#   "actualite",

#    - meta_contains_article_keyword
#    - crawler_contains_only_article_alikes
# (maybe not up-to-date, see ./newsplease/helper_classes/heursitics.py:
#  Every method not starting with __ should be a heuristic, except is_article)
# These heuristics can be overwritten by sitelist.json for each site
# default: {"og_type": True, "linked_headlines": "<=0.65", "self_linked_headlines": "<=0.56"}
enabled_heuristics = {"og_type": True, "linked_headlines": "<=0.65", "self_linked_headlines": "<=0.56"}

# Heuristics can be combined with others
# The heuristics need to have the same name as in enabled_heuristics
# Possible condition-characters / literals are: (, ), not, and, or
# All heuristics used here need to be enabled in enabled_heuristics as well!
# Examples:
#     "og_type and (self_linked_headlines or linked_headlines)"
#     "og_type"
# default: "og_type and (linked_headlines or self_linked_headlines)"
pass_heuristics_condition = "og_type and (linked_headlines or self_linked_headlines)"

# The maximum ratio of headlines divided by linked_headlines in a file
